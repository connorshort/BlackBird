## Why Would You Call It Like That?

Well, I'm European, and the fact that "blackface" is a controversial term was way in the back of my mind. I was more looking towards a line of Fender guitar amplifiers, which are commonly referred to as "blackface" due to the black design of their front panel (for example in Logic's Amp Designer). If there is a racial slur in the origin of this slang, that's very unfortunate.
